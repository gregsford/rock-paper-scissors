# rock-paper-scissors

This is my Rock, Paper, Scissors project from The Odin Project.
As of right now it's not very functional as I need to continue to work on it.

My goals to get the game running:
1. Make sure that the computer has a random selection for every game.
2. Fix the loop to make the game play for a certain number of times.
3. Making sure that the correct results are displayed after each game (rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, etc.)

Once the functionality of the game is complete, I will focus more on the styling of the game.
